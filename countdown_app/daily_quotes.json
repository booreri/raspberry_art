  "Anicca (Impermanence): This is the fundamental teaching that everything is constantly changing, in a perpetual state of flux.",

  "Mindfulness (Sati): Cultivating a non-judgmental awareness of the present moment.",

  "Direct Experience: Vipassana emphasizes direct, experiential understanding rather than intellectual or philosophical acceptance. It's about seeing these truths for oneself through sustained practice.",
  "Morality (Sila): Often, Vipassana courses begin with ethical guidelines (like abstaining from killing, stealing, false speech, etc.) to create a calm and conducive environment for mental purification.",
  "Concentration (Samadhi): Developing a focused mind, often through breath awareness (Anapana Sati) in the initial stages, to provide the stability necessary for deeper insight."
